"""LakeSail (Sail) against the OneLake Iceberg REST catalog, over Spark Connect.

Port of cell 12's `lakesail_iceberg` branch. Sail is a Rust Spark replacement with no JVM: the
process starts an in-process Spark Connect server and talks to it over gRPC on localhost.

TWO THINGS THE NOTEBOOK COULD IGNORE AND THIS CANNOT:

1. THE SERVER OUTLIVES THE SCRIPT. Sail's gRPC server runs on background threads that are not
   daemons, so a process that merely finishes `main()` hangs forever. A Fabric notebook cell does
   not care -- the kernel stays alive anyway. Here it would burn the job's entire timeout. Hence
   `close()` in a `finally`, plus the hard `timeout-minutes` on the workflow step behind it.

2. THE MEMORY POOL IS UNBOUNDED, and nothing here caps it. DataFusion's default pool has no
   ceiling, so Q21 at SF>=10 on a 16GB runner may be an OOM kill (exit 137, no traceback). An
   earlier version of this file invented `SAIL_EXECUTION__MEMORY_LIMIT` to cap it; that is not a
   real setting, and Sail validates its config STRICTLY -- it refused to start rather than
   ignoring the unknown key. The real keys are `runtime.memory_pool.type` (`greedy` or `fair`,
   default `unbounded`) and `runtime.memory_pool.fair.max_size`; both are marked experimental
   and neither is set here, because nothing OOMs at SF=10 and a pool limit means spilling.

ALSO: `grpcio-status==1.48.2` from cell 3 is deliberately NOT pinned here. That pin exists to
fight Fabric's preinstalled protobuf/grpcio stack; outside Fabric it actively breaks
pyspark-client, which declares its own floors.
