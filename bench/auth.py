"""OneLake credentials: GitHub OIDC in Actions, `az login` on a laptop.

WHY NOT AzureCliCredential, despite `azure/login` running in the workflow. `azure/login@v3`
performs `az login --federated-token <the GitHub OIDC assertion>`. That is a CLIENT-ASSERTION
flow, and client-assertion flows return NO REFRESH TOKEN. The assertion itself expires in minutes.
So once the first access token ages out (~60-90 min; Entra randomizes), the `az` session has
nothing left to renew with and every later `get-access-token` fails. AzureCliCredential LOOKS
auto-refreshing and is not, beyond the first token's lifetime.

ClientAssertionCredential over the GitHub OIDC endpoint has no such ceiling: it mints a FRESH
assertion on every refresh, straight from the Actions runtime. It needs no new trust
configuration -- same app registration, same federated credential, same
`api://AzureADTokenExchange` audience that `azure/login` itself uses -- and it removes the Azure
CLI from the Python process, so `bench/` behaves identically on a laptop.

WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT FIX. DuckDB bakes the token into `ATTACH` and LakeSail into an env var
read once at server start. Both capture a STRING and never ask again, so an engine session is
hard-bounded by the lifetime of the token it was handed. Mint late (right before engine setup),
never at job start.
